# Dutch

Dutch is an app designed to simplify the management of shared expenses across diverse scenarios. Whether organizing social events, managing household expenses, or coordinating any group activities that involve shared costs, Dutch helps ensure that financial contributions are recorded, tracked, and balanced fairly and efficiently.

## Getting Started
To get started with Dutch:

- **Deployed Application:** [Dutch Live](#) <!-- Add live app link -->
- **Backend Repository:** [GitHub Backend Repo](#) <!-- Add GitHub backend repo link -->

## Built with React and Vite
This project uses Vite, which provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects when compared to traditional setups like Create React App. Vite utilizes native ES modules and comes configured with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for React.

### React Fast Refresh
Integrated via the following Vite plugins:
- **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)** – Utilizes Babel for transforming React code.
- **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)** – Leverages SWC as a super-fast alternative to Babel.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:
- **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)** uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)** uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.
