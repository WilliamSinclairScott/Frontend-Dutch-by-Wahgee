# Dutch

Dutch is an app designed to simplify the management of shared expenses across diverse scenarios. Each of these we call a "Divvy". Whether organizing social events, managing household expenses, or coordinating group activities that involve shared costs, Dutch helps ensure that financial contributions are recorded, tracked, and balanced fairly and efficiently.
